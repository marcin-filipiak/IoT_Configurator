# IoT Configurator: Your Universal Electronic Device Configuration Wizard

Install IoT Configurator, an Android application that revolutionizes the configuration of your electronic devices through simplicity, efficiency, and universality. Our app enables the dynamic creation of configuration forms for IoT devices based on received JSON, all directly through Bluetooth technology. With this, you can configure any device compatible with this technology using just one application.

## Key Features:

Dynamic Configuration Wizard: As a developer, create configuration forms on the fly, adapting them to the specifications of the electronic device. This avoids unnecessary complexity in the configuration process and the creation of user interfaces that consume your microcontroller's memory.

Integration with [DeviceConfigJSON](https://github.com/marcin-filipiak/DeviceConfigJSON): Fully compatible with the popular microcontroller library called DeviceConfigJSON, available on Github and in the Arduino repository. This ensures compatibility and easy configuration for a wide range of devices.

Bluetooth Communication: Connect wirelessly to electronic devices through Bluetooth technology. Our app automatically receives configuration data, eliminating the need for complicated procedures.

User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive user interface makes device configuration easy, even for individuals without programming experience. Everything is at your fingertips!

The technology was developed with the ESP32 chipset in mind but can also be applied to other microcontrollers.
